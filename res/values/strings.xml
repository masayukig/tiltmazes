<string name="about_text"><b>TiltMazes - A logical puzzle game</b>\n
<i>Copyright © 2009, Balázs Lécz</i>\n
\n
A ball sits in a flat tray containing one or more squares (goals). The challenge is
to guide the ball around the tray and collect all the squares.
Tilt the phone to start the ball rolling.\n
The ball rolls in a straight line until it hits a wall, you can then tilt again.\n
\n
